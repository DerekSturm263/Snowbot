            '`/collect`: Collects some fresh snow from off the ground. Snow is needed to use `/throw`, `/build`, and `/pack`.\n\n' +

            '`/throw`: Throws a snowball at someone! When someone is hit by a snowball, they get timed out for 5 seconds.\n\n' +

            '`/build`: Builds something out of snow to take hits for you. Each build will block hits until it eventually breaks.\n\n' +

            '`/pack`: Packs a snowball with a random item from off the ground. This item increases the timeout time of your snowballs.\n\n' +

            '`/forecast`: Checks the current and upcoming weather. Each weather type impacts the cooldown on `/collect`.\n\n' +

            '`/stats`: Checks your current score, leaderboard standing, snow in-hand, packed object, and building.\n\n' +

            '`/leaderboard`: Checks this server\'s leaderboard. Leaderboard is organized from who has the most to least points.\n\n' +
            
            '`/opt in`: Opts in to using Snowbot. You will have access to all commands, and be able to be hit by snowballs.\n\n' +

            '`/opt out`: Opts out of using Snowbot. You will no longer be able to use most commands or be hit by snowballs.'
